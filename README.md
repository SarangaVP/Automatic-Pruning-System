# Automatic-Pruning-System
An automatic pruning system designed to detect the growth of shrubs and simulate the pruning process using a robotic arm. The system leverages MATLAB for image processing to identify shrub boundaries, Simulink for simulating the robotic arm's movements, and SolidWorks for designing and visualizing the mechanical components.
