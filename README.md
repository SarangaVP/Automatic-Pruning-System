# Automatic Pruning System

An innovative automatic pruning system designed to trim and maintain shrubs along the median strips of highways. The system integrates image processing and robotic arm control to automate the pruning process, enhancing the efficiency and safety of highway maintenance.

## System Overview

The system is divided into two main components:

1. **Image Recognition**: 
   - Uses high-resolution imaging sensors to detect the boundary of shrubs based on color recognition and edge detection algorithms.
   - MATLAB is used to process images and detect the region of interest for pruning.
   
2. **Robotic Arm**:
   - The system is designed for precise trimming and includes simulation models for testing.
   
## Technologies Used
