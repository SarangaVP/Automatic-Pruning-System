# Automatic Pruning System

An automatic pruning system designed to detect the growth of shrubs and simulate the pruning process using a robotic arm. The system leverages MATLAB for image processing to identify shrub boundaries, Simulink for simulating the robotic arm's movements, and SolidWorks for designing and visualizing the mechanical components.

## System Overview

The system is divided into two main components:

1. **Image Recognition**: 
   - Detect the boundary of shrubs based on color recognition and edge detection algorithms.
   - MATLAB is used to process images and detect the region of interest for pruning.
   
2. **Robotic Arm**:
   - The system is designed for precise trimming and includes simulation models for testing.
